Compare two definitions of "what is life" and output a single correlation coefficient between -1.0 and 1.0, where:

-1.0 = Fundamentally opposing or incompatible primary frameworks:
- Directly contradictory central mechanisms/principles
- Core emphasis on mutually exclusive elements (e.g., thermodynamics vs information)
- Incompatible necessary conditions
- Opposing philosophical foundations for the primary argument

-0.5 to -0.9 = Significantly different emphasis with some contradiction:
- Different primary elements with some logical conflicts
- Partially contradictory mechanisms
- Different core phenomena with tension between explanations

0.0 = Independent or orthogonal frameworks:
- Focus on completely different primary phenomena
- No meaningful overlap in core explanatory elements
- Different domains or levels of analysis without contradiction
- Separate explanatory traditions without direct conflict

0.1 to 0.4 = Slight overlap in secondary elements:
- Share some peripheral concepts but different core focus
- Compatible but mostly separate explanatory frameworks
- Minor overlapping elements but different primary emphasis

0.5 to 0.9 = Significant overlap with some differences:
- Same primary phenomena with different secondary emphasis
- Compatible core mechanisms with varying focus
- Shared fundamental principles with different elaboration
- Similar causal architecture with different specific mechanisms

1.0 = Aligned core frameworks:
- Identical primary explanatory elements
- Same core phenomena and mechanisms
- Matching necessary conditions
- Equivalent central claims and emphasis

When analyzing, prioritize:
1. Primary explanatory element (what is the MAIN thing being emphasized?)
2. Core phenomena (what is treated as the central aspect of life?)
3. Necessary conditions (what is claimed as absolutely required?)
4. Causal mechanisms (what is the primary explanation for how life works?)
5. Level of analysis (what scale/domain is centered?)

Secondary considerations:
6. System boundaries
7. Emergence properties
8. Time evolution
9. Relations and interactions

Scoring rules:
- Definitions must emphasize the same primary element for scores above 0.7
- Different core phenomena or mechanisms should score below 0.5
- Contradictory primary claims must score below 0.0
- Completely different explanatory focuses should score close to 0.0
- Identical definitions score exactly 1.0
- Scores should primarily reflect alignment of core elements rather than secondary features

For example:
- A thermodynamic definition vs an information-based definition ≈ 0.0
- A metabolic definition vs a genetic definition ≈ 0.0
- A replication-first vs metabolism-first definition ≈ -0.5
- Two thermodynamic definitions with different boundary conditions ≈ 0.8
- Two genetic definitions with different specific mechanisms ≈ 0.7
