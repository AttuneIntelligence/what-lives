Life is a system exhibiting agency, characterized by the ability to manipulate itself and its environment to achieve autonomously determined goals, maintaining a sustained thermodynamic separation from its surroundings and demonstrating context- and history-dependent responses to stimuli based on internal states.

## ANALYSIS

# Definition Theme Analysis Protocol

## Input Definition
"I don’t believe we have an adequate understanding of the range of possible behaviors in complex matter to attempt any universal definition of life, but to the extent that we know them, living systems all exhibit agency: the ability to manipulate themselves and their environment to achieve autonomously determined goals. I believe that it should be possible to operationalize a notion of agency more readily than to do so for “life”. Characteristic features would include a sustained thermodynamic separation of agent and environment, and a context- and history-dependence of responses to stimuli: an agent’s behavior makes reference not just to external conditions but to internal states. In addition: evolution by natural selection is not an intrinsic property of living things, but rather, is the only mechanism currently known by which the necessary complexity for agency might arise spontaneously."
