## CONSENSUS

Life is a systematic machine that operates to preserve and sustain patterns, emphasizing functional processes and the continuity of organization over physical composition.

## ANALYSIS

### Key Themes List
"These definitions share X major themes:"
1. **Machine**  
   - Present in the definition as the primary analogy for life.  
   - Important because it frames life as a functional system, emphasizing mechanisms and processes.  
   - Used to suggest that life operates systematically, like a machine with specific purposes or goals.

2. **Preservation**  
   - Central to the definition, highlighting the idea of maintaining or continuing something over time.  
   - Important because it implies that life’s primary function is self-sustenance and continuity.  
   - Used to define life’s purpose or goal as the act of maintaining its own existence.

3. **Patterns**  
   - Key concept that life is defined by the preservation of certain structures, forms, or behaviors.  
   - Important because it shifts the focus from physical matter to the organization or arrangement of that matter.  
   - Used to emphasize that life is not about what it is made of, but how it is organized and sustained.

### Connection Map
"These themes connect in the following ways:"
- **Machine and Preservation**  
  - The concept of a machine implies functionality, and preservation is framed as the machine's primary function.  
  - They relate because the machine (life) is designed or operates to achieve the goal of preservation.  
  - This connection suggests that life is fundamentally goal-oriented and process-driven.

- **Preservation and Patterns**  
  - Preservation is specifically tied to the maintenance of patterns, not just physical structures.  
  - They relate because the definition focuses on the continuity of organization or form, rather than the material itself.  
  - This connection highlights the abstract, informational nature of life.

- **Machine and Patterns**  
  - The machine analogy implies that patterns are the "output" or "product" that the machine works to maintain.  
  - They relate because the machine (life) is described as operating to sustain these patterns.  
  - This connection underscores the idea that life is a dynamic process, not a static entity.

### Shared Approach
"The definitions share these characteristics:"
- **Functional Perspective**  
  - Life is defined by what it does (preserves patterns), not what it is made of.  
  - Assumes that processes and functions are more fundamental to life than physical composition.

- **Abstract Focus**  
  - Emphasizes patterns and organization over material substance.  
  - Suggests that life is more about information and structure than physicality.

- **Systematic Framing**  
  - Uses the machine analogy to frame life as a system with a specific purpose or goal.  
  - Assumes that life operates systematically, with interconnected processes working toward preservation.

- **Goal-Oriented Definition**  
  - Life is defined by its purpose (preservation of patterns), implying intentionality or directionality in its processes.  
  - Assumes that life inherently works toward maintaining its existence.

This definition reflects a mechanistic, process-oriented view of life, emphasizing function, continuity, and the abstract nature of patterns over material composition.

## CONSENSUS

Life is a unique physical phenomenon governed by a new kind of physical law that grants causal efficacy to information, coupling it with chemical networks to drive processes and maintain order. This law operates on a global scale of complexity, transcending traditional, locally-defined physical laws, and reflects the non-local organization of living systems, which exploit the margins of thermodynamics to navigate energy and entropy constraints.

## ANALYSIS

### Key Themes List

"These definitions share 5 major themes:"

1. **Causal Efficacy of Information**
   - Present in: All definitions
   - Importance: Central to the idea that information is not merely abstract but has real, physical consequences in living systems.
   - Usage: Suggests that information plays an active, causal role in driving processes in living matter, beyond the traditional thermodynamic framework.

2. **Maxwell Demons and Thermodynamics**
   - Present in: All definitions
   - Importance: Highlights the interplay between life and the second law of thermodynamics, with life exploiting "margins" or loopholes in entropy increase.
   - Usage: Frames living systems as entities that manipulate energy and entropy through information processing.

3. **Coupling of Information and Chemical Networks**
   - Present in: All definitions
   - Importance: Emphasizes the integration of informational and material (chemical) processes as a hallmark of living systems.
   - Usage: Suggests that life operates through a tight coupling of abstract (informational) and physical (chemical) domains.

4. **Global Measure of Complexity**
   - Present in: All definitions
   - Importance: Proposes that the new law governing life would involve a holistic, system-wide measure of complexity, rather than localized quantities.
   - Usage: Positions complexity as a defining feature of living systems, requiring a global perspective to understand.

5. **A 'New Kind' of Physical Law**
   - Present in: All definitions
   - Importance: Indicates that the laws governing living matter differ fundamentally from traditional physical laws, particularly in their non-locality and focus on complexity.

### Connection Map

"These themes connect in the following ways:"

1. **Information and Thermodynamics**
   - Connection: The causal efficacy of information is linked to Maxwell demon-like behavior, where information processing allows living systems to locally reduce entropy.
   - Relationship: Information serves as a tool for life to navigate and exploit thermodynamic constraints.
   - Pattern: Life is seen as a system that uses information to manipulate energy flows and maintain order.

2. **Information and Chemical Networks**

   - Relationship: This coupling is what allows information to have causal efficacy in the material world.
   - Pattern: Living systems are hybrid entities where information and matter are deeply intertwined.

3. **Complexity and Non-Locality**
   - Connection: The global measure of complexity ties directly to the idea of a 'new kind' of physical law, which would operate on a system-wide scale rather than through local interactions.
   - Relationship: Complexity is both a product of and a requirement for the non-local, integrated behavior of living systems.
   - Pattern: The defining characteristics of life emerge from its global, non-local organization.

4. **Thermodynamics and Complexity**
   - Connection: Maxwell demon-like behavior and the coupling of information and chemical networks contribute to the global complexity of living systems.
   - Relationship: Life's ability to "play the margins" of the second law of thermodynamics is a key driver of its complexity.
   - Pattern: Complexity arises as a result of life’s strategies for managing energy and information.

### Summary

The definitions converge on the idea that living systems are governed by a 'new kind' of physical law that gives causal efficacy to information, integrates it with chemical processes, and operates on a global scale of complexity. This law would transcend traditional, locally-defined physical laws, reflecting the unique, non-local organization of life. The interplay between information, thermodynamics, and complexity is central to this framework, with life exploiting the margins of the second law to maintain order and drive its processes.
