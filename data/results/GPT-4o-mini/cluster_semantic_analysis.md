## CONSENSUS

Life is a property of an ensemble of units that can replicate information coded in a physical substrate, maintaining entropy significantly lower than the maximal entropy of the ensemble over extended timescales. Information flows within life are initially restricted to narrow spatial and temporal ranges and are carried by specific energetic and physical modalities, which evolve to become multivariate and expand across space and time.
